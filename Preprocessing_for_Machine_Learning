#Course Description

#This course covers the basics of how and when to perform data preprocessing. 
#This essential step in any machine learning project is when you get your data ready for modeling. 
#Between importing and cleaning your data and fitting your machine learning model is when preprocessing comes into play. 
#You'll learn how to standardize your data so that it's in the right form for your model, 
#create new features to best leverage the information in your dataset, and select the best features to improve your model fit. 
#Finally, you'll have some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings ready for modeling.
